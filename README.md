# pycanberradet

A Python wrapper for communicating with Canberra's radiation detectors via Genie 2000's registered DLL files in a sane way. `pycanberradet` enables users to carry out their own Python scripts and interact with their detectors in every possible way, starting and stopping and monitoring spectrum acquisition, changing detector parameters, saving and loading spectra, capturing error codes and more.

## Requirements

- Genie 2000 Basic Spectroscopy v3.0.0 or above
- Python 2.6 or above
- Numpy
