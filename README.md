# pycanberry

A Python wrapper for communicating with Canberra's radiation detectors via Genie 2000's registered DLL files in a sane way. `pycanberry` enables users to carry out their own Python scripts and interact with their detectors in every possible way. With `pycanberry` you can start and stop and monitoring spectrum acquisition, change detector parameters, save and load spectra, capture error codes and moreâ€”from the comfort of your Python routines.

## Requirements
